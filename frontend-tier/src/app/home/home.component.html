                            This application was deployed using Puppet Enterprise to demonstrate Configuration Management 
                            and Application Delivery. Cloud Automation Services integrates directly with a Puppet Master 
                            allowing Puppet Roles to be assigned at time of provisioning. Blueprints can be configured with
                            parameters to allow selecting from multiple Puppet roles. 
                            <br>
                            Cloud Automation Services acts as an execution engine for configuring this integration, Puppet
                            delivers Configuration Management, Drift Management, and configuration as code - partnering well
                            with our Infrastructure and Automation as code approach!
